# Introduction  to Enimo



## Technology Stack
The Enimo is purely built in **ReactJS** with some other dependencies which are given below: 

### Front-End Stack: 
1. **Redux** is used to handle the different states in the project. 
2. **ChartJS, ReCharts** are for handling the data provided and visualize them.
3. **React-Router** is used to switch from one link to another link.
4. **ParticleJS** for making the UI More attractive.
5. **FontAwesomeIcons, Weather Icons, LinearIcons** are the different types of icons used in the project.
6. **SCSS**: Instead of the normal CSS, we have used **SCSS** which be very useful in changing the color of the dashboard. 
7. **Bootstrap, Reactstrap**: For making the whole project responsive to the screen size of the device.
### Different API's:
1. **Solcast API**: This API tells the amount of solar energy which should be generated on a specific day and we compared this amount with the actual solar energy which should be generated.

2. **OpenWeatherMap API**: This API fetches the weather for the given current location.

3. **Axios Library**: We have used the Axios library to fetch the data from all of the API's

4. **ElectronJS**: The ElectronJs was used to create cross-platform desktop applications. 
### Back-End Stack:
1. **NoSQL Database**: We have used the cloud firestore as the database for the project. It can be easily configured and fetches the data very fast. 

2. **Cloud**: As all the data from the hardware component is sent to the cloud, we have all the data analysis algorithm present in the cloud. The insights are then sent to the database.
